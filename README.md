# Project GIF

A small web application for generating GIFs from YouTube videos. Not sure of the copy right stuff but hey this is just a class project.

For it to work on your system you will need `ffmepg` and `youtube-dl` installed.

It also requires a few font files in the folder named `fonts`, which I did not include for copyright reasons. The fonts and their filenames can be seen at the top of the `server.py` file.

You will need to have a Google Developer API key in your environment variable with the search functionality activated.
